This is a flutter project with login(with mobile OTP) as well as image-clicking functionality. 

we primarily have 3 pages 
1.	login page
2.	Feed screen
3.	Camera 
Pre-requisites 
      1.Dart
      2.Flutter
I first start with the login page which when authenticated goes to the feed page(soon to be updated), On there on bottom navigation we get a camera option which have functions like flipping camera or torch mode. The click file is directly uploaded to Firebase storage.

PS - i could'nt complete the whole project,I apologise for that, as i am a college student with a background of ECE Flutter is not remotly related to my academis, But i gave my 100% at this time tio this project
